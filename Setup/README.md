This course will require a computer with at least N GB of free disk space and N GB of ram. In this module we'll be downloading the Linux operating system XUbuntu and installing it as a virtual machine in Virtual Box. A virtual machine is a virtual computer that runs as a program within your regular operating system. 

In order to download Virtualbox we'll go to https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads. Alternatively, you can search for Virtualbox and click through to their site. The host operating system is the operating system you currently use, so if you are on Windows, you will download the Windows host package, OSX the OSX package, and Linux you can choose your appropriate download or install it through your favorite package manager. 

Once download you can click through the install instructions. Virtualbox will be installed and we'll be ready to install a guest operating system, the operating system that runs inside of the virtual machine. We'll be using XUbuntu in this course. Ubuntu is one of the most popular Linux distributions, it is heavily supported and most software for Linux tests on Ubuntu. By default, Ubuntu uses a window manager called Unity, and in the future it will switch to Gnome 3. The window manager consists of your desktop, file explorer, file menus and so on. Unity is somewhat graphics heavy, and while it is what I prefer on my desktop, it can be a little much in a virtual machine. That was a long winded way to say that we will be installing XUbuntu instead of Ubuntu. XUbuntu uses the window manager XFCE which is incredibly light. The underlying operating system, Ubuntu, is the same, it's just kind of the skin that is changing. 

To download XUbuntu we can go to https://xubuntu.org/getxubuntu/. Ubuntu does two yearly resleases, one in April (04) and one in October (10). The releases are coded by the year (16) and the month (04). A long term support, or LTS release, one that will be supported for 5 years is released every 2 years. The last LTS release at the time these videos were made was 16.04, so we'll download the 64bit version of that. If 18.04 becomes available you can grab that, but things might not line up exactly with what is shown in the videos, so be ready to tinker a little if you go that route. 

Once downloaded we will install XUbuntu in Virtual box by...
